I thought this summer would be lame and boring because I had to take two courses for SS II. Lucky for me, I was wrong (Well, partly because Calc still sucks). My Information and library sciences class (INLS 161) is so engaging and hands-on. Learning internet user fundamentals like the basic GIT workflow and how to write properly in markdown is not only fun but also pratical in this day and age where technology is growing at such a rapid pace. I hope to learn to use more tools that will help me to better style and create my personal online space where I can share/present my ideas, in an aesthetically pleasing and concise manner.
