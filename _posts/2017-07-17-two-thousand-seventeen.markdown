Here are two poems I wrote a *very long time ago*...

Motion 


The tides rise and fall

Years go on with lightning speed

You are ever still

Plan ahea


I seem to have lost my way  
  
Have I been led astray?  

Do my words no longer hold weight?

Is this what they call fate?




Not all who wander are lost
  
Not one effect without a cause

Even if the cost was nothing at all

We'd give it all we've got

  


One day the pieces all fall into place,
  
Fit, as do the stars in space
  
Constellations of a future near and bright
  
Shine in the moonlight
