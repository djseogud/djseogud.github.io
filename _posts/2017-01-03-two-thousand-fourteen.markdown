My INLS 161 class is so engaging and hands-on. Learning the basic GIT workflow and how to write properly in markdown is not only fun but also pratical in this day and age where technology is growing at such a rapid pace. I hope to learn to use more tools that will help me to better style and create my personal online space where I can share/present my ideas, in an aesthetically pleasing and concise manner.
