<p>I wrote these a very long time ago...</p>
<h1 id="motion">Motion</h1>
<p>The tides rise and fall</p>
<p>Years go on with lightning speed</p>
<p>You are ever still</p>

<h1 id="plan-ah">Plan ah</h1>
<p>I seem to have lost my way Have I been led astray? Do my words no longer hold weight? Is this what they call fate?</p>
<p>Not all who wander are lost Not one effect without a cause Even if the cost was nothing at all We'd give it all we've got</p>
<p>One day the pieces all fall into place, Fit, as do the stars in space Constellations of a future near and bright Shine in the moonlight</p>
